# Create a Playlist Lab
This was a Lab in my first computer science class at Brigham Young University. The goal was to use vectors, pointers, and classes to create songs and playlists that could be "played" and song counts increase. I upload as part of the tutorial of GitHub.

## Built With
Visual Studio in the C++ language

## Authors
Dallin Kooyman

### Acknowledgments
I followed the class instructions to create this project. The files are called TALAB8 because as a TA we would redo all assigments to make sure we could help the students. This was the 8th Lab while I was a Teaching Assistant for that class.
